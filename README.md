## Repository setup:

### Python files and to what parts of the paper they belong:
*Data scraping*
- multi_thread_data_scraper.py
    - Part of the papers Data scraping section (File 1/1)
    - This file was used to scrape the raw data for our dataset 

*Retrieving relevant paragraphs (document retrieval)*
- doc_retrieval_sentence_transformers_baselines.py
    - Part of paper's Document Retrieval Section (File 1/2)
    - This file is used to calculate the F1, Precision, Recall, MRR and MAP scores of a Hugging Face sentence transformers model against the bgb_eval dataset for the task of document retrieval

- doc_retrieval_open_ai_baseline
    - Part of paper's Document Retrieval Section (File 2/2)
    - This file is used to calculate the F1, Precision, Recall, MRR and MAP scores of the openAI GPT-3.5-turbo model against the bgb_eval dataset for the task of document retrieval

*answer generation*
- answer_generation_prep.py:
    - Part of the paper's Answer Generation Section (File 1/2)
    - This file queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate answers based on the layperson's questions and relevant paragraphs

- answer_generation_eval.py:
    - Part of paper's Answer Generation Section (File 2/2) 
    - We calculate the upper, lower borders and the actual model performance for our ROUGE, BERTScore.


## Data and datasets:
Files in the data subfolder:
- GerLayQA.json
    - Primary dataset with questions and answers targeting at the German BGB
- bgb_dev.json
    - Our splitted development part of the GerLayQA dataset
- bgb_eval.json
    - Our splitted evaluation part of the GerLayQA dataset
- bgb_train.json
    - Our splitted training part of the GerLayQA dataset
- bgb.json
    - Contains all (non-changed) paragraphs of the German BGB, is used as document collection within the document retrieval task
- stgb_QA.json
    - Dataset with questions and answers targeting at the German StGB
- zpo_QA.json
    - Dataset with questions and answers targeting at the German ZPO
- data_points_ag.json
    - this file is used within the answer generation part
    - it is an extended version to the bgb_eval.json with additionally properties for already created answers and rephrased layer's answers both by the LLM GPT-3.5-turbo model


## Requirements
- see the requirements.txt file

## How to run
- All files are python scripts that can be run via the cmd line with an installed python instance

## Accessing the results of the scripts
- The metrics calculated within the results are displayed after running the experiments within the command line
- As some scripts also do modify (or add) files, you can take a look at the script to see what files are used as output
