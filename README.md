## Repository setup:

### Python files:
- multi_thread_data_scraper.py
    - Part of the papers Data scraping section (File 1/1)
    - This file was used to scrape the raw data for our dataset 

- doc_retrieval_sentence_transformers_baselines.py
    - Part of paper's Document Retrieval Section (File 1/2)
    - This file is used to calculate the F1, Precision, Recall, MRR and MAP scores of a Hugging Face sentence transformers model against the bgb_eval dataset for the task of document retrieval

- doc_retrieval_open_ai_baseline
    - Part of paper's Document Retrieval Section (File 2/2)
    - This file is used to calculate the F1, Precision, Recall, MRR and MAP scores of the openAI GPT-3.5-turbo model against the bgb_eval dataset for the task of document retrieval

- answer_generation_prep.py:
    - Part of the paper's Answer Generation Section (File 1/2)
    - This file queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate answers based on the layperson's questions and relevant paragraphs

- answer_generation_eval.py:
    - Part of paper's Answer Generation Section (File 2/2) 
    - We calculate the upper, lower borders and the actual model performance for our ROUGE, BERTScore.
